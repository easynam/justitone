a song starts with a tempo, and then a bunch of events, eg.

120: >0 >20 >36

:5/4                    note, ratio
                        :5 and :/4 work too (5/1 and 1/4)

>0 >20 >36              note, keffies magic angle thing
                        (these are unison, major second, major third)

'5 '6 '7                note, superparticular ratio
                        '5 = :5/4, '6 = :6/5 etc

:5/4:11/10>30           multiply pitches

:5/4+
:5/4++                  multiply pitch by itself

-:5/4                   reciprocal
                        eg. -'5 = -:5/4 = :4/5

1/2:5/4                 note with length modifier. this one takes half as long
                        all events apart from modulations can have length modifiers

- 2-                    hold. continues the previous step (and example with double length)

_ 2_                    rest (and example with double length)

^:5/4                   modulate. doesnt play a note, but following notes within the group
                        have their pitches multiplied.

{>0 >20 >36}            group/bar/whatever. on its own, groups some events??
1/2{_ _ _}              group with length modifier, halfs length of each note it contains
:1/2{_ _ _}             group with pitch modifier, halfs pitch of each note it contains
1/2:1/2{_ _ _}          and both

[_ _ _]                 tuple, a group with a fixed length. events inside are spaced to
                        fill the tuple's total length
3/2[>0 >20 >36 >45]     this tuple has total length 3/2 and plays 4 notes evenly in that time

[_ _ [_ _ _]]           the third beat in this is a triplet wow

{line1, line2}          polyphony will play both lines at once

{
  line1,
  line2,
  line3
}                       if you do it like this its like sheet music

[line1, line2]          also works with tuples

.:1.'6.'5               chord. stacks intervals on top of eachother, so they are specified relative to the previous.
1/2:5/4.:1.'6.'5        you can change the root and length, wow
[:1 :2 :3].:1.'6.'5     multiply the chord by everything in the group bc ?????????
                        u can do planing like this

>0*2
[_ _ _]*2               repeat an event 2 times

<                       repeats everything before it in the current group
<2                      2 times
1/2<2                   twice as fast each time
1/2:5/4<2               and going up a major third each repetition
